The tester for the Divide et Impera parallel framework can be built with

g++ -o test test.cpp -march=native -Ofast -std=c++1z -pthread

If using amplx-gui for performance analysis you can add a -g3 tag to directly
view source code associated to measurements.

To get a brief summary of commands launch

./test

To get some more details about usage launch

./test info

or read Help.txt


If more details about the implementation idea or the performance measurement are
needed do not hesitate to contact me:
